15) Added some information in the --help/-h/-? option
16) --debugger option no longer force the log file
17) Added a --dram-max option to extend the DRAM size to 8MB

Release 1 (12th February 2017)
------------------------------
0) BPM (Breapoint) now stop at the designated address and no longer stop after executing the code

6) Added a GPU disassembly tracing window - Display the current PC pointer
7) Added a DSP disassembly tracing window - Display the current PC pointer
8) Added possibility to change refresh rate of browser windows when emulation is launched
9) Display partial hardware labels (Internal Memory and Graphics sub-system address space) in the disassembly lines displayed in the M68K tracing window
-- Display first the hardware labels (based from the Jag V8 dev. PDF) and then the ones possibly found in the ELF debug symbol
10) Minor U.I cosmetic changes
11) User can turn on/off the hardware labels associated in the disassembly lines displayed in the M68K tracing window

Known issues
============
1) Video output is not displayed due to my OpenGL / QT5 5.5.1 integration with VS 2015 but solved when using the QT 5.9.1 package for VS 2017
2) The BPM (Breapoint) remains stuck on his address when user wants to continue the code execution
-- Need to trace over the BPM or unset the BPM
3) To handle DWARF 2 issues with GCC, the code must be compiled with the -gdwarf-2 option
4) The Local and Watch variables list may display not available (N/A) type information
-- Such missing information may be included in future release
5) The 2MB mirroring is no longer applied in case of --dram-max option usage
6) Stack must reflect the --dram-max option usage otherwise the stack may be corrupted
-- The application needs to set the SP (Stack) in accordance
7) The Exception Vector Table broswer window displays only 65 vectors
-- Missing vectors may be added in future release
8) User needs to manualy check if the Atari Jaguar executable match his source code files
-- Otherwise, source code and assembly may not match or leads to instabilities
9) Application needs to be restarted in case of keybindings changes

Cosmetic / UX issues
====================
1) The SP (Stack) icon color backgound doesn't look similar with the other ones
2) The emulator status option has no icon
3) The SP (Stack) window size always open at a forced size no matter if the size has been changed
4) Not every features have associated keybindings

Legacy issues/hints
===================
1) Emulator seems to have easter egg(s)
-- The option --yarrr displays a single message and end the application
-- Pressing F8, while in the main window, will create an extra message in the log file
2) The --alpine option force the log file but it can be override if --no-log option is set after the --alpine option
